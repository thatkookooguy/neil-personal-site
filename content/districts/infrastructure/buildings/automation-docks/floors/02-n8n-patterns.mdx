# n8n patterns

n8n is a powerful automation tool, but it needs structure to stay maintainable.

## Patterns I use

- **Modular workflows**: Break complex automations into smaller, reusable pieces
- **Error handling**: Every workflow has explicit error paths
- **Logging**: Important decisions are logged for debugging
- **Testing**: Test workflows with sample data before production

## The n8n test

If you can't understand what a workflow does by reading it, it's too complex.

Workflows are code. Treat them with the same care as any other code.
