# From home lab to production

Home labs are great for experimentation, but production needs reliability. Here's how to bridge that gap.

## What production requires

- **Monitoring**: You need to know when things break
- **Backups**: Data loss isn't acceptable in production
- **Documentation**: Someone else should be able to run it
- **Security**: Production systems need proper access controls

## The production test

If you can't hand your automation to someone else and have them run it, it's not production-ready.

Home labs teach you how things work. Production teaches you how things fail.
