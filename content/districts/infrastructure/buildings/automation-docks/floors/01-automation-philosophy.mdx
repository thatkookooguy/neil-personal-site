# Automation as a product

Automations are products. They need to be designed, tested, and maintained like any other system.

## What good automation does

- **Solves real problems**: Automates tasks that are actually painful
- **Fails gracefully**: When automation breaks, it doesn't break everything
- **Is observable**: You can see what automation is doing and why
- **Is maintainable**: Future you can understand and modify it

## The automation test

If you can't explain what an automation does and why it exists, it shouldn't exist.

Automation isn't about eliminating work—it's about eliminating repetitive work.
