# Reliability without complexity

Self-hosted systems need to be reliable, but reliability doesn't require complex orchestration.

## What reliable self-hosting means

- **Automated backups**: Data is backed up without manual intervention
- **Health checks**: Systems monitor themselves and alert on problems
- **Simple recovery**: Restoring from backup should be straightforward
- **Documentation**: Runbooks for common failure scenarios

## The reliability test

If you can't recover from a complete failure in under an hour, your reliability setup isn't complete.

Reliability is about preparation, not perfection.
