# Security as a default

Self-hosted systems need security by default, not as an afterthought.

## What secure self-hosting means

- **Least privilege**: Services only have access to what they need
- **Regular updates**: Security patches are applied promptly
- **Network isolation**: Services are segmented and firewalled
- **Access control**: Authentication and authorization are enforced

## The security test

If you can't explain who has access to what and why, your security model isn't clear enough.

Security isn't a feature—it's a property of how the system is designed.
