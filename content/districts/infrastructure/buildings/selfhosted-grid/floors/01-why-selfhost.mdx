# Why self-host

Self-hosting isn't about saving money or avoiding vendors. It's about control, privacy, and understanding your systems.

## What self-hosting gives you

- **Data sovereignty**: Your data stays in your infrastructure
- **Customization**: You can modify and extend tools to fit your needs
- **Learning**: Running infrastructure teaches you how systems work
- **Independence**: You're not locked into vendor decisions

## The self-host test

If you can't explain why you're self-hosting a particular service, you probably shouldn't be.

Self-hosting is a tradeoff. Make it deliberately.
