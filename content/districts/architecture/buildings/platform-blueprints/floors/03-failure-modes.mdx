# Designing for failure

Systems fail. Good systems fail gracefully and make it easy to understand what went wrong.

## What failure-aware design means

- **Fail fast**: Detect problems early, before they cascade
- **Fail clearly**: Errors explain what happened and what to do
- **Fail safely**: Failures don't corrupt data or leave systems in bad states
- **Fail observably**: Failures are logged and traceable

## The failure test

If a failure requires reading source code to understand, the system isn't failing clearly enough.

Failure modes are part of the interface. Design them as carefully as success paths.
