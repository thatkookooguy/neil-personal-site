# Platform design principles

Platforms exist to enable other developers. Good platforms make common things easy and hard things possible.

## What I optimize for

- **Developer productivity**: Can teams ship faster using the platform?
- **Consistency**: Do all teams follow the same patterns?
- **Autonomy**: Can teams work independently without breaking each other?
- **Clarity**: Is it obvious how to use the platform correctly?

## The platform test

If developers consistently work around the platform instead of using it, the platform isn't serving them.

Platforms are products. They need to solve real problems for real developers.
