# Interfaces as contracts

Interfaces define how systems interact. Good interfaces are stable, clear, and easy to use correctly.

## What interfaces should do

- **Hide complexity**: Consumers don't need to know implementation details
- **Provide guarantees**: Clear contracts about what the interface promises
- **Enable evolution**: Interfaces can change without breaking consumers
- **Document intent**: The interface explains what it's for

## The interface test

If developers need to read implementation code to understand how to use an interface, it's not clear enough.

Interfaces are promises. Keep them simple and keep them stable.
