# Unifying events across systems

When multiple providers or platforms emit similar concepts differently, the cost isn't technical — it's cognitive.

## The approach I prefer

- Map external events into **internal canonical events**
- Keep provider-specific logic at the edges
- Let the rest of the system reason in one language

This reduces coupling, simplifies testing, and makes it easier to evolve integrations independently.
