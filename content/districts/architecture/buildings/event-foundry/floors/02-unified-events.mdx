# Unified event modeling

Events are the language systems use to communicate. A unified event model makes that communication predictable and debuggable.

## What unified events provide

- **Consistency**: All events follow the same structure
- **Traceability**: You can follow an event through the system
- **Debuggability**: Events tell a story of what happened
- **Extensibility**: New consumers can subscribe without changing producers

## The event test

If you can't trace an event from producer to consumer without reading code, your event model isn't unified enough.

Events aren't just messages—they're the system's memory.
