# Understanding tradeoffs

Every architectural decision involves tradeoffs. The key is making them explicit and choosing deliberately.

## Common tradeoffs

- **Consistency vs. availability**: Can you wait for consistency, or do you need immediate availability?
- **Simplicity vs. flexibility**: Do you optimize for now or for future changes?
- **Performance vs. maintainability**: How much complexity are you willing to accept for speed?
- **Centralization vs. distribution**: Where should logic live?

## The tradeoff test

If you can't explain what you're giving up for what you're gaining, you haven't thought through the tradeoff.

Good architecture isn't about avoiding tradeoffs—it's about choosing the right ones.
