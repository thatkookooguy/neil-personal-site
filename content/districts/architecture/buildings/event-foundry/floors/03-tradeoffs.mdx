# Tradeoffs I make consciously

I rarely optimize for maximum flexibility.

Instead, I prefer:
- fewer concepts
- clearer flows
- explicit constraints

This sometimes means:
- slower initial experimentation
- saying "no" to clever abstractions

But it usually pays back with:
- easier onboarding
- fewer production surprises
- systems that teams can reason about under pressure
