# Boundaries before events

Event-driven systems only work if boundaries are clear first.

Events are not a shortcut around design — they *amplify* whatever structure already exists.

## My rule of thumb

If you can't clearly explain:
- who owns the data
- who is allowed to emit changes
- who is allowed to react

then events will increase confusion instead of reducing it.

Good event systems start with clear ownership, then add communication.
