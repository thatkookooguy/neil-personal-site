# Boundaries that scale

Good boundaries make systems easier to understand, change, and operate. Bad boundaries create coupling and confusion.

## What boundaries define

- **Ownership**: Who is responsible for this piece?
- **Interfaces**: How do other systems interact with this?
- **Data**: What data lives here, and what's shared?
- **Failure**: When this breaks, what else breaks?

## The boundary test

If changing one service requires changing three others, your boundaries are wrong.

Boundaries aren't just technical—they're organizational. They define how teams work together.
