# Building community

Open source is about people, not just code. Good communities make projects sustainable.

## What community means

- **Welcoming**: New contributors feel comfortable participating
- **Clear**: Contribution guidelines and project direction are obvious
- **Responsive**: Questions and contributions get timely responses
- **Inclusive**: Everyone can participate regardless of background

## The community test

If new contributors don't know how to get started, your community isn't welcoming enough.

Communities don't happen by accident. They need to be designed and maintained.
