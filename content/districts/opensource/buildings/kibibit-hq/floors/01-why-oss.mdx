# Why open source

Open source isn't just about code—it's about building in public, learning from others, and creating leverage.

## What open source gives you

- **Learning**: Building in public forces you to think clearly
- **Community**: Other developers can help improve your work
- **Leverage**: Your code can help others solve similar problems
- **Portfolio**: Public work demonstrates your capabilities

## The open source test

If you wouldn't use your own open source project, why should anyone else?

Open source is a commitment. Make it thoughtfully.
