# Kibibit projects

Kibibit is my open source organization. It's a collection of tools and libraries that solve real problems.

## What Kibibit represents

- **Practical tools**: Software that solves actual problems
- **Good defaults**: Tools that work well out of the box
- **Clear documentation**: Projects that are easy to understand and use
- **Sustainable maintenance**: Projects I'm committed to maintaining

## The project test

If a project doesn't solve a problem I have, I shouldn't be building it.

Open source projects are products. They need to provide value.
