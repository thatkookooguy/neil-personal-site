# What is Achievibit

Achievibit is a gamification platform for engineering teams. It turns code contributions into achievements, making progress visible and fun.

## What Achievibit does

- **Tracks achievements**: Recognizes when developers hit milestones
- **Creates visibility**: Shows team progress in a fun, visual way
- **Encourages good practices**: Rewards things like small PRs and good tests
- **Builds culture**: Makes engineering excellence visible and celebrated

## The Achievibit test

If achievements don't align with what you actually want developers to do, gamification won't help.

Gamification works when it reinforces good behavior, not when it creates perverse incentives.
