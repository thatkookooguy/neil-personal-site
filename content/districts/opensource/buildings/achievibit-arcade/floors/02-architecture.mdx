# Achievibit architecture

Achievibit is built on events. Code contributions trigger events, which trigger achievements, which create visibility.

## Key components

- **Event ingestion**: Pulls events from GitHub, GitLab, and other sources
- **Achievement engine**: Evaluates events against achievement rules
- **Display layer**: Shows achievements in dashboards and notifications
- **API**: Allows teams to customize achievements and integrations

## The architecture test

If adding a new achievement type requires changing core code, the architecture isn't flexible enough.

Event-driven architecture makes Achievibit extensible without being complex.
