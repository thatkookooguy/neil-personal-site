# Mini-games and engagement

Achievibit includes mini-games that make engineering work more engaging without being distracting.

## What mini-games do

- **Create moments of delight**: Small surprises that make work fun
- **Encourage exploration**: Games that reward trying new things
- **Build team connection**: Shared experiences that bring teams together
- **Reinforce learning**: Games that teach engineering concepts

## The mini-game test

If a mini-game distracts from actual work, it's not a good mini-game.

Games should enhance work, not replace it.
