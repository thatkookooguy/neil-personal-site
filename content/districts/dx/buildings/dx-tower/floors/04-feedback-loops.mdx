# Tight feedback loops

The faster developers can see the impact of their changes, the faster they can iterate and learn.

## What makes a good feedback loop

- **Immediate**: Tests run in seconds, not minutes
- **Actionable**: Failures point to the problem, not just "something broke"
- **Visible**: Status is obvious without hunting through logs
- **Reversible**: Mistakes are easy to undo

## The cost of slow feedback

When feedback takes minutes or hours, developers:
- Context-switch away while waiting
- Batch changes together (making debugging harder)
- Lose confidence in their changes

Fast feedback isn't just convenient—it changes how developers work.
