# Workflows that reduce friction

Good workflows don't just automate steps—they reduce the number of decisions developers need to make.

## What I look for

- **Clear entry points**: Where do I start? What's the first command?
- **Predictable paths**: If I do X, what happens next?
- **Fast feedback**: Can I see results in seconds, not minutes?
- **Safe defaults**: Does the system prevent mistakes, or just document them?

## The workflow test

If a new team member can't complete a common task in under 5 minutes without asking questions, the workflow needs work.
