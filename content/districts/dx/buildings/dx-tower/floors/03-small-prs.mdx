# Small PRs are a scaling strategy

Small pull requests aren't about etiquette. They reduce risk and increase throughput.

## What small PRs buy you

- Faster reviews
- Fewer conflicts
- Easier debugging and rollback
- Clearer ownership of decisions

## The real trick

Small PRs require small responsibilities—modules that are allowed to change independently.

If the architecture forces large changes, the PR size is a symptom, not the cause.
