# Defaults that guide, not constrain

Good defaults make the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. Great defaults make the right thing obvious.

## What good defaults do

- Reduce decision fatigue: "Just use the default" is a valid answer
- Encode best practices: New team members inherit good patterns
- Enable escape hatches: When you need to override, it's clear how

## The default test

If developers consistently override a default, the default is wrong—or the system is making the wrong thing easy.

Defaults are a form of documentation. They show what the system expects.
