# DX is a design discipline

Developer experience isn't "nice-to-have polish." It's the difference between a system that scales and a system that slowly drains a team.

## My working definition

DX is the set of constraints and affordances that determines whether developers can:

- understand the system
- change it safely
- debug it under pressure
- collaborate without friction

If a team ships less because they're confused, anxious, or constantly context-switching, that's a DX problem—whether or not the UI looks pretty.
