# Confidence is a product

Developers need to trust the system. Not "hope it works," but actually understand what will happen.

## What confidence looks like

- **Predictable behavior**: "If I do X, Y will happen"
- **Clear failure modes**: "When this breaks, I know why"
- **Observable state**: "I can see what's happening right now"
- **Debuggable errors**: "This error tells me where to look"

## The confidence test

Can a developer explain what happened after a failure without reading source code? If not, the system isn't giving them enough information.

Confidence isn't about perfection—it's about clarity.
