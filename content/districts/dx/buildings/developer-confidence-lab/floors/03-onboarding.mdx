# Onboarding as a product

Onboarding isn't documentation—it's the experience of becoming productive in a new system.

## What good onboarding does

- **Reduces time to first value**: Can they ship something meaningful in day one?
- **Builds mental models**: Do they understand how pieces fit together?
- **Establishes patterns**: Do they know how to do things "the right way"?
- **Creates safety**: Can they experiment without breaking things?

## The onboarding test

If a new team member needs to ask "how do I..." questions after the first week, onboarding isn't complete.

Good onboarding makes the system feel approachable, not intimidating.
