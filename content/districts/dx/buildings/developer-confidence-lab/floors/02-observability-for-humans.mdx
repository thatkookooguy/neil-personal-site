# Observability for humans

Observability isn't just metrics and logs—it's making the system's behavior understandable to the people who need to reason about it.

## What observability means here

- **State visibility**: What's the system doing right now?
- **Change visibility**: What changed and when?
- **Decision visibility**: Why did the system make this choice?
- **Failure visibility**: What broke and what's the impact?

## The human test

If a developer needs to SSH into a server or read raw logs to understand what happened, the observability layer isn't doing its job.

Good observability answers questions before they're asked.
