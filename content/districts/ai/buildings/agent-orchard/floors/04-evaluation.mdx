# Evaluating agent performance

You can't improve what you don't measure. Agent evaluation needs to be systematic and human-centered.

## What to measure

- **Task success rate**: Does the agent complete its assigned tasks?
- **Human satisfaction**: Do developers find the agent helpful?
- **Time saved**: Is the agent actually reducing work?
- **Error rate**: How often does the agent make mistakes?

## The evaluation test

If you can't tell whether an agent is improving over time, you're not evaluating it properly.

Evaluation isn't just about metrics—it's about understanding how agents fit into real workflows.
