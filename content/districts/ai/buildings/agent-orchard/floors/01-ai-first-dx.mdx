# AI-first DX

"AI-first" doesn't mean replacing developers. It means designing workflows where AI reduces cognitive load and increases clarity.

## The bar I use

AI is useful when it helps developers:

- reason about tradeoffs
- find the right context quickly
- test assumptions safely
- reduce repetitive work without hiding complexity

AI is harmful when it:

- creates output nobody can explain
- makes decisions without auditability
- increases noise and coordination cost
