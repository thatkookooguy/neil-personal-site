# Agents in teams

Agents work best when they have clear roles, boundaries, and ways to collaborate with humans.

## What I've learned

- **Role clarity**: An agent should have a specific job, not "help with everything"
- **Human oversight**: Critical decisions stay with humans; agents handle execution
- **Transparency**: Agents should explain what they're doing and why
- **Reversibility**: Humans can always step in and override

## The team test

If developers don't trust the agent enough to let it work autonomously, it's not ready. If developers can't understand what the agent did, it's not transparent enough.

Agents are team members. They need the same clarity and boundaries as human teammates.
