# Guardrails and boundaries

AI systems need boundaries. Not to limit capability, but to ensure safety and predictability.

## What guardrails do

- **Prevent dangerous actions**: Don't let agents do things that can't be undone
- **Enforce policies**: Make sure agents follow organizational rules
- **Require confirmation**: Ask humans before making high-impact decisions
- **Log everything**: Create an audit trail of agent actions

## The guardrail test

If you wouldn't give a junior developer this level of access without review, don't give it to an agent without guardrails.

Guardrails aren't about limiting AI—they're about enabling trust.
