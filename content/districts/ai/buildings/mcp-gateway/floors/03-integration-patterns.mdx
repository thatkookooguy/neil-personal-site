# Integration patterns

MCP enables consistent patterns for connecting agents to tools, databases, and APIs.

## Common patterns

- **Read-only access**: Agents can query but not modify
- **Approval gates**: Agents propose changes, humans approve
- **Scoped access**: Agents only see data relevant to their role
- **Audit logging**: All agent actions are logged for review

## The pattern test

If every integration requires custom security logic, you're not using patterns—you're building one-offs.

Good patterns make secure integrations the default, not the exception.
