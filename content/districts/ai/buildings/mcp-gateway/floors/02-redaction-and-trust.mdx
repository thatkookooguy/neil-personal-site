# Redaction and trust

Agents need access to data, but not all data should be exposed. Redaction is how you maintain privacy while enabling capability.

## What redaction enables

- **Selective access**: Agents see what they need, not everything
- **Privacy preservation**: Sensitive data stays protected
- **Audit trails**: Clear records of what agents accessed
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements without blocking agents

## The trust test

If you can't explain what data an agent can access and why, you don't have proper boundaries.

Redaction isn't about hiding things—it's about giving agents the right level of access.
