# Why MCP

The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for AI agents to interact with tools and data sources—with built-in privacy and security boundaries.

## What MCP solves

- **Standardization**: One protocol for agent-tool integration
- **Security**: Built-in redaction and access controls
- **Composability**: Agents can use multiple tools without custom integrations
- **Observability**: Clear boundaries make it easier to audit agent actions

## The MCP test

If you're building custom integrations for every tool an agent needs, you're solving the wrong problem.

MCP isn't just a protocol—it's a way to think about agent boundaries.
