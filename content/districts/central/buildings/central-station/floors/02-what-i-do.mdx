# What I do (in practice)

I usually get pulled in when systems feel heavy, unclear, or stuck—especially when the problem isn't only technical.

## The work tends to look like this

- Designing boundaries: services, modules, interfaces, and ownership.
- Introducing AI into real workflows without turning it into noise.
- Building developer experience as a product: defaults, tooling, feedback loops.
- Making systems explain themselves: observable behavior, clear failure modes, debuggability.
- Enabling teams: mentoring, decision frameworks, and reusable patterns.

## What I optimize for

- Clarity over cleverness
- Small units that scale (PRs, interfaces, responsibilities)
- Trust: humans can predict the system, and the system can be audited
