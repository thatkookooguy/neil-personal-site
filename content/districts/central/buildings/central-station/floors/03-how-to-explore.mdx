# How to explore the city

- Start in the **district view** (overview).
- Click a **district** to zoom in and reveal more buildings.
- Click a **building** to see it as a cutaway skyscraper.
- Scroll floor by floor—each floor is one coherent section.

If you prefer a normal reading experience, everything is still written and structured like a standard website. The city is a visual layer on top of content.
