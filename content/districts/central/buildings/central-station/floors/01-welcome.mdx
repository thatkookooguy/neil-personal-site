# Neil Kalman

I help engineering teams regain leverage by designing AI-first systems and developer experiences that scale socially as well as technically.

This site is a city. Each district represents a major domain of my work. Buildings are deep dives. Inside a building, floors are the content sections—written to read like a normal page, but presented as a cutaway skyscraper.
