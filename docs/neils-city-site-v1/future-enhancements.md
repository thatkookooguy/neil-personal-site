# Neil's City Site — Future Enhancements

## Captured Ideas for Post-V1

### 1. Isometric Building View with City Life

**From:** Phase 1 review discussion

**Idea:** Instead of a pure side-view cutaway, make the building view isometric as well. This would allow:
- Showing (possibly blurred) people/characters moving in city streets below
- Maintaining visual consistency with the city overview
- Adding ambient life and depth to the building experience
- More immersive feeling of "being in the city"

**V1 Decision:** Start with side-view cutaway for simplicity
**V2 Consideration:** Upgrade to isometric with street-level activity

### 2. Neil Blog Writer Integration

**Idea:** Use the `neil-blog-writer` agent for tone consistency
- Could review/refine floor content to match Neil's voice
- Ensures consistent tone across all written content
- Potential automated tone checking

### 3. Design Token Flexibility

**Requirement:** All design decisions (colors, typography, spacing) must be:
- Stored as CSS custom properties
- Easy to modify post-launch
- Potentially theme-able
- Documented for future updates
