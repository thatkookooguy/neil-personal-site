# Neil's City Site — Brand Identity

## Core Concept

A personal portfolio presented as an **explorable futuristic isometric city**. The metaphor shapes everything:

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| City | Entire body of work & thinking |
| District | Major domain (DX, AI, Architecture, Infra, OSS) |
| Building | Specific topic / project / deep dive |
| Floor | One scrollable content section |
| Train | Traversal between domains (navigation glue) |

**The metaphor is never explained to visitors.** It should feel intuitive, not narrative.
