## Cross-Journey Patterns

### The Train as Guide

The train serves different roles for different users:

| User Type | Train Role |
|-----------|-----------|
| First-time visitor | Discovery aid, visual delight, learning metaphor |
| Returning visitor | Quick navigation, skip if unnecessary |
| Recruiter | May ignore, focused on content |

### Content Discovery Patterns

```
Pattern 1: Exploration (First-time)
City → District → Building → Floor → Related Floor → Different District

Pattern 2: Direct Access (Returning)
Search → Floor → Related Floor → Exit

Pattern 3: Evaluation (Recruiter)
City → Relevant District → Sample Floors → Central Station → Exit
```

### Common Exit Points

| Exit Point | User Type | Reason |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| City View | All | Confused, bounced |
| After 1 floor | First-time | Content didn't match interest |
| After 1 floor | Returning | Found what needed |
| After 2-3 floors | Recruiter | Formed impression |
| After deep exploration | First-time | Content fatigue, satisfied |

---

## Edge Cases & Alternative Paths

### Edge Case 1: Mobile First Visit
**Scenario**: User lands on mobile, city visual may not work as well  
**Path**: Simplified city view → List-based district selection → Same content experience  
**% of Users**: ~40%

### Edge Case 2: Direct Link to Floor
**Scenario**: User arrives from Google search to specific floor  
**Path**: Floor content (with context) → May explore building → May leave  
**% of Users**: ~20%

### Edge Case 3: JavaScript Disabled
**Scenario**: User has JS disabled or slow connection  
**Path**: Static list view → Same content accessible via links  
**% of Users**: ~2%

### Edge Case 4: Accessibility User
**Scenario**: Screen reader user navigating site  
**Path**: Skip links → Landmark navigation → Content focus  
**% of Users**: ~3%

---

## Journey Metrics Summary

| Metric | First-Time | Returning | Recruiter |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Avg Session | 5-10 min | 2-5 min | 3-8 min |
| Floors Viewed | 3-5 | 1-2 | 2-3 |
| Districts Visited | 2-3 | 1-2 | 1-2 |
| Return Rate (30 day) | 20% | 40% | 10% |
| Share Rate | 5% | 2% | 3% |

---

## Key Insights

1. **City View is a double-edged sword**: Delightful for curious users, potential friction for goal-oriented users. Solution: Easy skip/search option.

2. **Central Station is critical**: Serves as orientation for first-time, about page for recruiters, skippable for returning users.

3. **Train is optional navigation**: Should enhance but never block. Power users will use keyboard shortcuts.

4. **Search is essential for returning users**: `Cmd+K` search palette is not optional.

5. **Deep links must work perfectly**: Many users will arrive at specific floors from search engines.

6. **Content quality > site novelty**: Creative presentation attracts attention but content creates return visits.

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement instant search** (`Cmd+K` palette) - critical for returning users
2. **Central Station as "Start Here"** - orient first-time visitors and provide about/bio
3. **Deep link support** - every floor URL must load complete context
4. **Mobile-first floor content** - content is the product, must work on mobile

### Medium Priority
1. **"What's New" indicator** - attract returning visitors
2. **Related content links** - increase content discovery
3. **Share buttons on floors** - encourage organic sharing
4. **Visited indicators** - help users track exploration

### Low Priority
1. **Save/bookmark feature** - nice to have for power users
2. **Newsletter signup** - optional, non-intrusive
3. **Tour mode** - guided first-time experience (if metrics show confusion)
