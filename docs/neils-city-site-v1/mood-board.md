# Neil's City Site — Mood Board & Visual Style Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project:** Personal Portfolio as Futuristic Isometric City

---

## 1. The Visual Vision

### Core Aesthetic Statement

> **"A hand-crafted digital city that feels like a lost Ghibli film set in a cozy retro-futurist world — warm enough to linger in, detailed enough to explore, and timeless enough to revisit."**

This isn't about recreating Ghibli or copying pixel art. It's about capturing **feelings**:

- The **warmth** of Howl's Moving Castle's interiors
- The **wonder** of exploring Spirited Away's bathhouse
- The **satisfaction** of a well-designed 16-bit town
- The **coziness** of a game you played as a child

---

## 2. Reference Imagery — Studio Ghibli Films

### Primary References

#### **Howl's Moving Castle** (2004)
*Why it matters:* The interior scenes with warm browns, oranges, and that magical golden light filtering through windows.

**Take from this:**
- Warm, lived-in color palette
- Mechanical elements that feel organic
- Light that feels like late afternoon
- Details that suggest a larger world

**Specific scenes:**
- The cluttered workshop with herbs and bottles
- Sophie's bedroom with sunlight through curtains
- The castle's brass and copper mechanisms

---

#### **Spirited Away** (2001)
*Why it matters:* The bathhouse architecture — layers upon layers of buildings, each district with its own character.

**Take from this:**
- Vertical architecture (buildings stacking upward)
- District-based color coding (red for main areas, blue for boiler room)
- Transition spaces that feel magical
- Signs and details that create world-building

**Specific scenes:**
- The approach to the bathhouse at dusk
- The boiler room with Kamaji (industrial warmth)
- The train over water (peaceful, contemplative movement)
- **The bathhouse at night** — thousands of glowing windows against the dark sky, lanterns creating warm pools of light, the magical contrast of warm interiors against cool night air

---

#### **Kiki's Delivery Service** (1989)
*Why it matters:* The European seaside town — charming, human-scaled, with character in every building.

**Take from this:**
- Approachable, non-intimidating architecture
- Terracotta roofs and cream walls
- Small business storefronts with personality
- Integration of nature and city

**Specific scenes:**
- The bakery interior and exterior
- Aerial views of the coastal town
- The clock tower and surrounding plaza
- **The town at dusk/evening** — warm amber lights beginning to glow in windows, the transition from day to night captured beautifully, streets becoming intimate and cozy

---

#### **Porco Rosso** (1992)
*Why it matters:* The Adriatic aesthetic — warm Mediterranean colors, aviation romance, Art Deco hints.

**Take from this:**
- Teal water against warm stone
- Industrial elements (planes, workshops) with beauty
- Sunset and golden hour prevalence
- Male protagonist with rugged charm (Neil reference)

---

### Secondary References

| Film | What to Extract |
|------|-----------------|
| **Castle in the Sky** | Floating city architecture, industrial age beauty, sky-blue accents |
| **The Wind Rises** | Technical precision with emotional warmth, blueprint aesthetics |
| **Whisper of the Heart** | Cozy interiors, creative workspaces, urban warmth |
| **From Up on Poppy Hill** | 1960s palette (teals, oranges), student clubhouse energy |

---

### Night Scene References (Critical for Dark Mode)

The key to Neil's City night mode is capturing Ghibli's **warm nighttime magic** — nights that feel cozy and inviting, never cold or threatening.

#### **Spirited Away — Bathhouse at Night**
The quintessential reference for warm urban night scenes.

**Take from this:**
- **Thousands of glowing windows** — warm amber/gold light spilling outward
- **Lantern light** — creates pools of warmth in the darkness
- **Steam and atmosphere** — adds depth and mystery
- **The contrast** — warm interiors against cool blue-purple night sky
- **Activity suggested** — silhouettes, movement behind windows

**Specific elements:**
- Window glow color: warm amber (#F5D88A range)
- Sky gradient: deep purple-blue to warm brown horizon
- Light sources create visible pools/halos
- Buildings feel alive and inhabited

---

#### **Howl's Moving Castle — Interior Glow**
How warm interior light looks from outside at night.

**Take from this:**
- **Fireplace glow** — that magical warm orange radiating outward
- **Candle flicker** — soft, living light
- **Window as beacon** — a single lit window as focal point
- **Warm wood tones** — how materials look under warm artificial light

---

#### **Kiki's Delivery Service — Town at Dusk**
The beautiful transition from day to night.

**Take from this:**
- **The in-between moment** — when sky is purple but buildings still catch last light
- **First lights appearing** — scattered windows beginning to glow
- **Street lamps igniting** — creating paths of light
- **Silhouette buildings** — distant structures become dark shapes against the sky

**Key learning:** Night doesn't arrive all at once — it's a beautiful gradient.

---

### Night Mood Summary

| Element | Color/Treatment | Emotional Goal |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| Sky | Deep purple-blue (#1A1A2E) to warm horizon (#2D2A3A) | Cozy, not threatening |
| Stars | Warm white (#FFFAF0), subtle twinkle | Magical, not cold |
| Windows | Amber glow (#F5D88A) | Life, warmth, invitation |
| Street lamps | Warm white (#FFF8DC) | Safety, guidance |
| Shadows | Deep warm purples/browns | Soft, never pure black |
| Train | Warm headlight beam, lit windows | Moving warmth through night |

**Remember:** Ghibli nights are **cozy**, not **spooky**. Every light source should feel like an invitation, not illumination against danger.

| **Eastward** | Ghibli-meets-pixel, urban environments |

---

## 4. Texture & Pattern Suggestions

### Surface Textures

#### Paper/Parchment Base
The city should feel like it's drawn on warm paper, not rendered on a screen.

```
Implementation:
- Subtle paper texture overlay at 3-5% opacity
- Slight warm grain in background areas
- Soft edges on illustrations (not hard pixel edges everywhere)
```

#### Pixel Dithering
Classic technique that bridges Ghibli painterly and pixel art crispness.

```
Implementation:
- Use dithering for gradients in sky/background
- Checkerboard patterns for shadows
- Limited to background elements, not UI
```

#### Hand-Drawn Line Quality
Lines should feel drawn, not generated.

```
Implementation:
- 2-3px line variation in illustrations
- Slightly rounded corners (never perfectly geometric)
- Occasional intentional imperfection
```

### Pattern Library

#### Architectural Patterns

1. **Brick** — Warm terracotta, slightly irregular grid
2. **Roof Tiles** — Overlapping scallops in orange/brown
3. **Windows** — Simple rectangles with light reflection dots
4. **Wood Planks** — Horizontal lines with grain suggestion

#### Environmental Patterns

1. **Foliage** — Clustered circles in 2-3 green tones
2. **Water** — Horizontal wave lines, animated subtly
3. **Sky Gradient** — Dithered bands from cream to soft blue
4. **Clouds** — Soft-edged, Ghibli cumulus style

#### UI Patterns

1. **Card Texture** — Subtle shadow with paper grain
2. **Button Surfaces** — Slight bevel, pixel-perfect edges
3. **Borders** — 2px solid with corner detail
4. **Progress Bars** — Rounded segments, not smooth fill

---

## 5. Pixel Art Integration Guidelines

### The Balance

Neil's City is **NOT** a full pixel art site. It's a modern web experience with pixel art **flavor**.

```
Spectrum:
Full Pixel Art ←——●————→ No Pixel Art
                (here)
             "Pixel-influenced"
```

### Where Pixel Art Appears

| Element | Pixel Art Level | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Character illustrations | **High** | Neil & Leela in pixel style |
| Building illustrations | **Medium** | Isometric, some pixel detail |
| Icons & small graphics | **High** | 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icons |
| Backgrounds | **Low** | Painterly with dithered gradients |
| UI Components | **None** | Clean, modern, accessible |
| Typography | **None** (mostly) | Exception: accent pixel font |
| Photos | **None** | No photos in the aesthetic |

### Pixel Art Technical Specs

```css
/* Base pixel sizes for consistency */
--pixel-base: 4px;      /* Smallest unit */
--pixel-small: 16px;    /* Small icons, details */
--pixel-medium: 32px;   /* Standard icons, small sprites */
--pixel-large: 64px;    /* Character portraits */
--pixel-xlarge: 128px;  /* Building sprites */
```

### Scaling Rules

Pixel art must scale at **integer multiples** only:

- ✅ 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x scaling
- ❌ 1.5x, 2.5x, or any non-integer scale

```css
/* Proper scaling */
.pixel-art {
  image-rendering: pixelated;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;
}
```

### Character Sprite Guidelines

**Neil:**
- Base size: 32x48 pixels
- Walking animation: 4 frames
- Idle animation: 2 frames (subtle breathing)
- Color count: 12-16 colors max

**Leela:**
- Base size: 24x20 pixels
- Walking animation: 4 frames
- Tail wag idle: 3 frames
- Color count: 8-10 colors max

## 7. Animation Principles

### Ghibli-Inspired Movement

#### Breathing World
Everything has subtle life, even "static" elements.

```
Examples:
- Curtains sway slightly
- Smoke drifts from chimneys
- Leaves occasionally fall
- Leela's tail wags intermittently
```

#### Weight and Follow-Through
Movement should feel physical, not digital.

```
Examples:
- Train decelerates into stations
- Characters bob slightly when walking
- Doors swing with momentum
- Flags unfurl with drag
```

### Pixel Art Animation

#### Limited Frame Approach
Classic 4-8 frame animations feel appropriate.

```
Walk cycle: 4 frames
Idle: 2-3 frames
Action: 4-6 frames
```

#### Squash and Stretch (Subtle)
Even pixel art benefits from animation principles.

```
Jump: Slight anticipation, stretch at peak, squash on land
Wave: Follow-through on arm and hand
```

### Transition Animations

#### Train Navigation
The signature transition between districts.

```
Pattern:
1. Current district slides (0.3s ease-out)
2. Train enters frame (0.2s)
3. Train crosses (0.4s with parallax layers)
4. New district slides in (0.3s ease-out)
```

#### Building Entry
Entering a "building" (topic) from the district view.

```
Pattern:
1. Building grows/zooms (0.4s ease-out)
2. Interior fades in through windows (0.2s)
3. Content appears floor by floor (staggered 0.1s each)
```
