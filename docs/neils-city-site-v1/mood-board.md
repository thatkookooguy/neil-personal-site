# Neil's City Site — Mood Board & Visual Style Guide

## The Visual Formula

```
(Studio Ghibli Warmth × 60%) + (Pixel Art Charm × 30%) + (Modern Clarity × 10%)
```

This creates a style that is:
- **Timeless** — not locked to a specific era
- **Warm** — inviting, not sterile
- **Crafted** — feels hand-made, not generated
- **Playful** — whimsical moments without being childish

## Texture & Pattern Guidelines

### DO Use

#### Paper Textures
- Subtle paper grain in backgrounds
- Aged parchment feel for content areas
- Not too heavy — hint of texture, not dominant

#### Pixel Grids (Selective)
- 8×8 or 16×16 grid hints in certain areas
- Character sprites sit on pixel grid
- Icons can have pixel base
- Never applied to body text

#### Atmospheric Particles
- Floating dust motes
- Gentle parallax layers
- Steam/smoke in appropriate areas
- Subtle, not distracting

#### Hand-drawn Line Quality
- Slight imperfection in building outlines
- Not perfectly geometric
- Feels sketched, then cleaned up
- Ghibli-style confident strokes

### DON'T Use

- ❌ Heavy grunge textures
- ❌ Aggressive noise overlays
- ❌ Photorealistic textures
- ❌ Stock pattern fills
- ❌ Overly clean vector precision everywhere

## Pixel Art Integration Guide

### Where Pixel Art Appears

| Context | Pixel Style | Size |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Character sprites (small) | Full pixel | 32×32 to 64×64 |
| Character sprites (large) | Ghibli illustration | N/A |
| Floor number indicators | Pixel font | 16px height |
| Achievement notifications | Pixel icons | 24×24 |
| Open Source district UI | Heavy pixel | Various |
| Loading animations | Pixel | 32×32 |
| Error state illustrations | Hybrid | Medium |

### Where Pixel Art Does NOT Appear

- Body text (always modern fonts)
- Primary navigation
- Form inputs
- Serious content areas
- Mobile-specific UI
- Accessibility-critical elements

### Pixel Density Rules

```
Base unit: 4px
Small sprites: 16×16, 24×24, 32×32
Medium sprites: 48×48, 64×64
Large sprites: 96×96, 128×128

Scale: Always whole number multiples (2×, 3×, 4×)
Never: Fractional scaling that blurs pixels
```

## Animation Principles

### Ghibli-Inspired Motion

#### Anticipation & Follow-Through
- Characters "wind up" before actions
- Motion continues slightly past endpoint
- Organic, weighted movement

#### Breathing Environments
- Subtle movement even in "static" scenes
- Parallax layers at different speeds
- Floating particles, swaying elements

#### Meaningful Transitions
- Train movement tells navigation story
- Building reveals have purpose
- Never just "fade in/out"

### Pixel-Inspired Motion

#### Frame-Limited Animation
- Character sprites: 8-12 fps feel
- UI elements: Can be smoother (30fps+)
- Creates stylistic contrast

#### Snappy State Changes
- Pixel UI elements can "pop" instantly
- No need for easing on small pixel changes
- Creates satisfying feedback

## Color Application Examples

### Scenario: City Overview (Day)

```
Background: Warm sky gradient (cream to soft blue)
Mid-ground: Districts in their theme colors
Foreground: Train tracks with golden highlight
Atmosphere: Subtle warm haze between layers
```

### Scenario: Building Cutaway

```
Background: District-themed gradient
Building shell: Neutral warm gray
Active floor: Highlighted with district glow
Inactive floors: Desaturated, darker
Neil & Leela: Full color, slight glow
```

### Scenario: Night Mode / Dark Theme

```
Sky: Deep blue-purple with stars
Buildings: Lit windows as focal points
Train: Warm light trail
Text areas: Cream text on warm dark brown
Accents: Glow effects become more prominent
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### DO

✅ **Layer depth** — Background, mid-ground, foreground
✅ **Use warm shadows** — Tinted, not pure gray/black
✅ **Add atmospheric effects** — Subtle, purposeful
✅ **Show personality in details** — Small discoveries
✅ **Maintain consistency** — Same sun direction, same shadow style
✅ **Use negative space** — Not every area needs detail
✅ **Prioritize readability** — Content first, always
✅ **Create visual hierarchy** — Guide the eye naturally
✅ **Animate with purpose** — Every motion means something
✅ **Respect the pixel grid** — When using pixel elements

### DON'T

❌ **Use pure black or white** — Everything has warmth
❌ **Over-saturate** — Ghibli palettes are muted
❌ **Add detail for detail's sake** — Purposeful complexity
❌ **Mix pixel sizes inconsistently** — Commit to a grid
❌ **Animate everything** — Rest is powerful
❌ **Use generic stock elements** — Everything should feel crafted
❌ **Forget accessibility** — Style doesn't trump usability
❌ **Make it feel "AI generated"** — Hand-crafted feeling is key
❌ **Overuse glow effects** — Selective enhancement
❌ **Ignore performance** — Beauty at the cost of speed fails
